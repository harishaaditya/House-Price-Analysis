# House-Price-Analysis

This project revolves around an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the various factors affecting residential house prices in the United States. The dataset contains detailed information about thousands of house transactions, including geolocation details, house features, and economic indicators such as inflation rates and airport distances. The goal is to uncover patterns, correlations, and trends that influence house pricing and derive actionable business insights.

Problem Statement:

The real estate market is influenced by a diverse set of factors ranging from location and property size to economic and infrastructural variables. The challenge in this project is to identify how these factors—both independently and in combination—affect house prices, and to build data-driven strategies that can aid realtors, buyers, and policy-makers in making informed decisions.

Dataset Overview:

The dataset consists of features like:

Geographic variables: Country, Region, State, City, Postal Code

Property characteristics: Size of house (Small/Medium/Large), Built Year, House Area (excluding basement), Basement Area, Living Area

Socio-economic indicators: Inflation Rate, Airport Distance, Number of Schools Nearby

Additional details: Waterfront presence, Sale date, and Final sale price (price_in_usd)

Each record corresponds to a house transaction, with fields that capture both physical attributes and surrounding environmental factors.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

The EDA began with univariate and bivariate analyses. Price variations were explored across different regions, house sizes, and states. Statistical summaries such as mean, median, and standard deviation provided a sense of dispersion and skewness in pricing. Key findings include:

Houses in waterfront areas or closer to airports generally commanded higher prices.

House size (Small, Medium, Large) had a direct and clear influence on pricing.

Older houses, especially those built before 1950, often had smaller areas and fetched lower prices, unless significantly renovated.

Hypothesis Testing:

Several hypotheses were formulated and tested:

Do house prices differ significantly across states and regions?

Does the presence of waterfront or proximity to schools/airports influence house prices?

Is there a relationship between living area (post-renovation) and sale price?

Correlation matrices and scatter plots revealed strong relationships between living area and price, while other factors like basement area showed weaker correlations.

Insights and Business Recommendations:

Geographical Influence: States on the East Coast showed higher average prices compared to others, especially for large-sized homes.

Renovation Pays Off: Properties with increased living area post-renovation were consistently sold at higher prices.

Infrastructure Matters: Proximity to essential services and infrastructure such as airports, schools, and waterfronts positively influenced the price.

Policy Recommendations: Government and developers should invest in regions with high housing potential, especially where airport and school infrastructure is already present or planned.

Conclusion:

The project offers a holistic view of the real estate pricing ecosystem. By combining geographic, structural, and economic data, it presents a robust framework for understanding house price dynamics. These insights can guide realtors in pricing strategies, assist buyers in making informed choices, and help city planners with better infrastructure allocation.
